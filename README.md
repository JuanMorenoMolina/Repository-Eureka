# Repository-Eureka

System.out.println("Hello World");

This repository has been created to tell the story of "hello world".

The phrase "Hello, world!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the 1978 book "The C Programming Language".

Did you know that the first programming language was invented by a woman in 1843?

Ada Lovelace devised the first algorithm for a primitive computing machine, which she wrote on a piece of paper because computers did not exist at that time.
